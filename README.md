Visual design & UX of your choice.

### Basic version:

* The application should display information about launch platforms used by SpaceX (all of them).
* Data should be displayed as a list containing information about name, status, and thumbnail photo.
* Clicking on each element of the list should display details about each platform (name, status, location, detailed description, etc).

### Optional: (If you have spare time, its not super important or anything)

* Add possibility to view launch site location on the map, for this use https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk.
* Add an option to view a list of vehicles launched from a certain location (Including rocket details, you will find information about that in API documentation).
